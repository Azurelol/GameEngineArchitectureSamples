# Sample Graphics Pipeline

This sample project demonstrates the implementation of a graphics pipeline for a game engine through the use of a layered design pattern where an interface abstracts the implementation details, which are contained inside classes whose purpose is to implement the graphics rendering. For this sample I will be doing so with OpenGL.

If you are not familiar with OpenGL, before reading this sample I **strongly** encourage you to go over the tutorials at [Learn OpenGL](http://learnopengl.com/). In particular, go through the 'Getting Started' series. For this sample is not centered around explaining how OpenGL works, but in how to write a graphics pipeline for an ECS engine.
