# Sample Tracer

This sample project demonstrates the implementation and use of a simple logging system for your engine. While not-quite-deceptively simple, a properly implemented logging system, even if barebones can save you many hours in debugging if used consistently and judiciously.

**Notes**

1.	There's a series of custom macros used for quickly doing traces off rather than having to write the whole thing manually. Some of the macros have expanded behavior such as appending the name of the function as a prefix. I suggest the reader modify these and add more as they see fit.
