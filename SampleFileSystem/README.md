# Sample FileSystem Library

This sample project demonstrates a simple implementation of a FileSystem libray for generic use. This allows common operations such as being able to scan a directory
and retrieving a list of all the files on it with their paths, finding out whether a file exists, the last time it was modified, etc.
The implementation has been written using the C++ experimental <filesystem> [library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh874694.aspx)
