# Sample Editor

This sample demonstrates the implementation of a simple visual Editor through the use of an immediate-mode GUI library. Which in this case is the excellent [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
This library, dear imgui, can be integrated into graphics pipelines using the following APIs:

- DirectX 9/10/11
- OpenGL / OpenGL 3.0+

I have also included bindings for the following multimedia APIs:

- SFML
- GLFW
- SDL
